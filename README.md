# Fake Tweet Tool
This tool let's you create real looking fake tweets to fool your friends

You can set pretty much everything to your needs:
  - amount of comments
  - amount of retweets
  - amount of likes
  - amount of views
  - amount of bookmarks

You can also toggle if you have:
  - retweeted
  - liked
  - bookmarked
 
You can use a custom:
  - avatar
  - username
  - twitter handle
  - time since post (e.g. 20m or 3d)

This is the heart of the UI:

This how the Results look like:

## it is possible to use HTML in the handle and in the post itself
like here, where i added the Valve Logo infront of the handle to make it look real

Here are some stupid examples 
(some of them with the older Version, 
that's why the spaceing for likes, retweets,... doesn't fit):
